                    <p>The day will be filled with one-on-one conversations, which will be scheduled for each student. There will also be lunch included. When registrations open in a few weeks, you can indicate what time slots would be suitable for you in the registration form so we can make a schedule that will fit you! We will try to schedule as many company talks as you are interested in, however, we can not guarantee you will be scheduled with all your choices. </p><p>
The day will start with a workshop and throughout the day, there will also be talks about pursuing a career in the industry or academia. It is also possible to sign up for these talks in the registration form. Stay updated on the site or the Facebook page for the content of the workshop and the speakers.
