                            Existing search solutions in the legal industry have not evolved for decades and only provide keyword-based searches. Results are therefore not exhaustive, less relevant and the entire process is time-consuming. Bluetick creates a context-aware search engine for lawyers in close cooperation with a wide range of law firms. Underlying natural language processing algorithms detect context in searches and documents which allows lawyers to find all relevant legal documentation in a fraction of the time compared to alternatives.<br>
