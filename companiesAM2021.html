                            ASML is a high-tech company, headquartered in the Netherlands. We manufacture the complex lithography machines that chipmakers use to produce integrated circuits, or computer chips. We build some of the most technologically advanced, machines that you will ever see (and the software to run them) to develop smaller, faster and still more affordable chips. Over 30 years, we have grown from a small startup into a multinational company with over 60 locations in 16 countries and annual net sales of &euro;14.0 billion in .<br>

                            At DSW we prefer to create our own software applications. We hardly ever use ready-made programs. Our systems for processing healthcare expenses claims, for the registration of new clients or for robotics: our own people designed, developed and tested each and everyone of these. Are you interested in development, but still lacking the skills? No problem! We have our own training programs for C# and SQL to make sure you can quickly become a full-fledged member of our teams for developing applications. Building our own chatbot Nikkie or integrating IDEAL in our app, to make it easier for the insured to pay their bills? Our developers consider it a piece of cake!<br>

                            We provide consultancy services around management of floods and droughts in the broadest sense: rivers, deltas, coastal areas, polders, and cities, now and in future climate situations. Mathematics and physics play a key role in our work. Statistical and probabilistic methods are used in risk assessments and development of mitigating measures. Optimization and systems control are applied to operational water systems, for example to reduce energy-use of pumping stations and to ensure optimal operation of hydropower dams. A large part of our work consists of the combination of physics with (numerical) mathematics, applied to hydraulic, weather and climate modelling. Data science and artificial intelligence are used in all domains of our work, from precipitation nowcasting to monitoring dikes.<br>

                            Blue Radix creates automated intelligence for daily decisions in the greenhouse. With the continuous growth of the world population, the need for healthy food is increasing. The greenhouse horticulture business is currently scaling up on a global level. But this scale up cannot be achieved due to a lack of crop experts. At the same time, energy management is increasing in complexity. We have a solution for these worldwide challenges: our algorithm-based solutions offer growers a digital brain for their greenhouse. We believe that algorithms actually can feed the world. Are you eager to help us achieve this great ambition? That's great! Don't hesitate - get in touch!<br>
