                        Blue Radix creates automated intelligence for daily decisions in the greenhouse. With the continuous growth of the world population, the need for healthy food is increasing. The greenhouse horticulture business is currently scaling up on a global level. But this scale up cannot be achieved due to a lack of crop experts. At the same time, energy management is increasing in complexity. We have a solution for these worldwide challenges: our algorithm-based solutions offer growers a digital brain for their greenhouse. We believe that algorithms actually can feed the world.
