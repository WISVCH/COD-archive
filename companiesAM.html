                        Blue Radix creates automated intelligence for daily decisions in the greenhouse. With the continuous growth of the world population, the need for healthy food is increasing. The greenhouse horticulture business is currently scaling up on a global level. But this scale up cannot be achieved due to a lack of crop experts. At the same time, energy management is increasing in complexity. We have a solution for these worldwide challenges: our algorithm-based solutions offer growers a digital brain for their greenhouse. We believe that algorithms actually can feed the world.

                        TOP-Advisory was founded in early 2020 by Harm Mulder, Jeroen Koppenens and Roderick Loeber.
                        They are trained as econometricians/actuaries and have worked for a considerable period of time at various consultancy organizations. We believe that with a background of actuarial services and risk management TOP -Advisory will be able to apply these quantitative skills and knowledge both within the actuarial sector as well as outside.

Our systems for processing healthcare expenses claims, for the registration of new clients or for robotics: our own people designed, developed and tested each and everyone of these. Are you interested in development, but still lacking the skills? No problem! We have our own training programs for C# and SQL to make sure you can quickly become a full-fledged member of our teams for developing applications. Building our own chatbot Nikkie or integrating IDEAL in our app, to make it easier for the insured to pay their bills? Our developers consider it a piece of cake!
