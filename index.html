                <h2>Career Orientation Days - 20/04/2022 & 21/04/2022</h2>
                <p>In last year’s edition of the Career Orientation Days a day for the Computer Science students was added. The Mathematical Career Orientation Days was renamed to the Career Orientation Days. In this year’s edition of the Career Orientation Days there will also be presentations on the Computer Science day! We are very glad that the event can go on physically in building 28 on the campus this year. On the 20th of April the day will be organised for Computer Science students and on the 21st of April the day for Applied Mathematics students will take place.</p>
                <p>The Career Orientation Days are aimed at students who are currently studying Applied Mathematics or Computer Science & Engineering and are eager to find out what they can do after finishing their studies. During the event, you will get the opportunity to have one-on-one talks with graduates of your study who are currently working at the participating companies. This can just be an orienting conversation, but the interview may also directly lead to a job, internship or graduation project!</p>
                <p>Both days will start with a workshop and throughout the day, there will also be talks about pursuing a career in the industry or academia. It is also possible to sign up for these talks in the registration form, which will be available later.</p>
                <h3>Registration</h3>
                <p>The registrations will open on the 4th of March! Stay updated about this on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1314968632261495">Facebook Event page.</a> </p>
